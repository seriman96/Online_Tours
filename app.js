//Rate limiter implementation: it preventing same ip for making too(so) many requests to our API n that will help us preventing attacks like DoS(denied of service), brute force attacks

//2 more package used to improve our application security n this time used to performe data sanitization means to clean all the data that comes into application from malicious code it's code 
//that is trying to attack our application n in this case we're trying to defend against two attacks(cross site scripting n NoSQL query injection)
//the 2 package are: express-mongo-sanitize n xss-clean n xss(cross-site scripting) n they should be installed first then used

// Data sanitization against NoSQL query injection exple: from postman log route body: {email:{"$gt": ""}, password:"pass1234"} so here without knowning the email we're able to log in the 
//application n it's n exple of nosql query injestion  
app.use(mongoSanitize()); //will return a middw function which we can then use n will prevent us for nosql query injection attack

// Data sanitization against XSS(cross site scripting) exple of xss attack: from postman signup route body:{"name": "<div id='body-code'>None</div>","email": "tester@natours.io",
//"password": "pass1234","passwordConfirm": "pass1234","role": "guide"} n after applying this security to our app we'll get output 
//as {"name": "&lt;div id='body-code'>None&lt;/div>"}
app.use(xss()); //will prevent us for some malicious html code

//parameter pollution usage: for this problem we'll used hpp package which stand for Http Parameter Pollution n to use it we should first install it
// Prevent parameter pollution used to clear out the query string (the one coming from user) n the problem is sending something in route different to string where we're expecting string
//{{URL}}api/v1/tours?sort=duration&sort=-price the query not allowed without preventing parameter pollution bcs it outputs an array n not a string
app.use(
